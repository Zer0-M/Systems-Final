Description
#################################################
Recreate a version of the popular card game UNO using what we have learned in class.
Rules:
- Every player is a dealt a hand of 7 cards
- Each player views his/her cards(by color or number) during their turn and tries to match the card in the Discard Pile.
- The first player to run out of cards wins
- If a player has one card left, they must call uno or else someone else may call uno and make the player with one card left draw two more cards

Technical Design
#################################################
- Networking
The server will connect to one player at a time and show them the card at the top of the discard pile and switch to the next player after receiving a card from the player.

- Shared Memory
The top card in the draw pile which will be dealt when a player doesn't have a matching card in hand will remain in a shared memory segment while all the cards are on the server which the players cannot see.

-Signal
To call “uno” a player must press a key. The keypress will send a signal to the server that checks if a player has one card left. If the player that called uno (sent the signal) is the player with only one card, they are “safe” for the turn. Otherwise, the player with only one card must draw two more. 

- Memory Allocation
The players hand is stored in a dynamic array as the number of cards will keep changing in the players hand

- Data Structures and Algorithms
The server will likely store the card deck as a stack
It might be helpful to use a dequeue to manage the order of turns.

-Responsibilities
Since the main difficulty with this project is figuring out how the server will work, we will both work on that cooperatively
Mohammed J. will handle how the client,in this case the player, works
Mohammed U. will handle how the deck will work in terms of randomizing the deck and how the draw pile will function
