## Description
Recreate a version of the popular card game UNO using what we have learned in class.
Rules:
- Every player is a dealt a hand of 7 cards
- Each player views his/her cards(by color or number) during their turn and tries to match the card in the Discard Pile.
- The first player to run out of cards wins
- If a player has one card left, they must call uno or else someone else may call uno and make the player with one card left draw two more cards


## Instructions to start
1. Clone the repository and navigate to the cloned repository. 
2. Enter "make"
3. Enter "./dealer <number of players (optional)>
4. Players connect by doing ./player
